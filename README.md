## Music Choice
https://project1-dehar42.herokuapp.com

My project is called music choice. The artist **H.E.R.** was my inspiration behind this. I wanted to showcase her musical talent, so you can see the song image cover, the name of the song, artist, and tweets about her. 

### Problems
I've had problems trying to get my Heroku config variables to work from within my code.

### Issues
- Took some time to get the album image to show, I thought I needed to do something within python and took a long time. Just to figure out it was a easy solution, src="whatever_my_genius_link_is".
- Had problems with the API calls, just to find out that I had an extra space somewhere in the Authorization. I took a long time trying to figure it out, even got frustrated. Once I found it, I realized I need to slow down.
- In the beginning, I only had 1 file and I got confused about where things where and what I was doing. So, I decided to make myself 3 .py files, 1 file for each API call and another to bring everything together.
